## About visualization

Crown shyness is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.

### About visualization


This effect was simulated with Voronoi tessellation. Visualization was implemented in [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) and [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
